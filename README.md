## 🏥 Current Focus
**Dokterian** – a medical management platform that **reduces appointment booking time by 80%** and **eliminates scheduling conflicts** for medical practices.

## 💼 Business Impact Portfolio

### 🏥 Dokterian – Medical Practice Management
- **Problem Solved:** Medical clinics waste 2+ hours daily on manual appointment scheduling  
- **Solution:** Automated booking system with conflict prevention  
- **Impact:** Streamlines appointment scheduling, prevents conflicts, and saves staff time.
- **Tech:** FastAPI, Angular, PostgreSQL, JWT Auth (to be added)  
- **Repos:**  
  - [dokterian-angular-deployed](https://github.com/igornlemos/dokterian-angular-deployed)  
  - [dokterian-fastapi](https://github.com/igornlemos/dokterian-fastapi)  
  - [dokterian-angular](https://github.com/igornlemos/dokterian-angular)

### 📊 Coming Next: IT Ticket Evaluation System
- **Problem:** Support and IT teams often lose productivity due to unclear ticket quality and lack of actionable feedback.
- **Solution:** A customizable ticket evaluation tool that allows users and peers to rate tickets across key criteria. The system generates **data-driven reports and dashboards**, helping managers identify training needs, improve processes, and provide targeted feedback.
- **Target Impact:** Increase ticket resolution speed by 30% while boosting team collaboration, accountability, and service quality.
- **Vision:** This project comes from my experience in customer support — identifying the need to measure ticket handling quality. The goal is to make it available for Atlassian clients, either via the **Atlassian Marketplace** or as a deployable app for client instances.
